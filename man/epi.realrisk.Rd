\title{An R version of the Winton Centre's RealRisk calculator}

\description{
A function to return absolute risks from odds, incidence risk and hazard ratios.
}

\usage{
epi.realrisk(measure, measure.type, rE0)
}

\arguments{
  \item{measure}{scalar, the numeric estimate of the specified measure of association.}
  \item{measure.type}{character string, detailing the measure of association type. Options are \code{odds.ratio}, \code{risk.ratio}, \code{hazard.ratio} and \code{pct.change} (percentage change).}
  \item{rE0}{scalar, the prevalence of the outcome in the exposure negative ('baseline') group. Must be a number between 0 and 1.}
}

\value{
A data frame with four elements: \code{measure}, the numeric estimate of the measure of association (as entered by the user), \code{measure.type} the measure of association type (as entered by the user), \code{rE0} the prevalence of the outcome in the exposure negative ('baseline') group and \code{rE1} the prevalence of the outcome in the exposure positive ('comparison') group.}

\examples{
## EXAMPLE 1:
## A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine if 18 to 44 year olds 
## who routinely used e-cigarettes were at greater risk of stroke compared 
## with individuals of the same age who did not smoke (Parekh et al., 2021). 
## The risk of stroke among those 18 to 44 years of age was estimated to 
## be 0.6\% per year. 

## Current dual use of e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes was associated 
## with a 2.91 times higher odds of stroke compared with non-smokers 
## (adjusted OR = 2.91, 95\% CI 1.62 to 5.25). Report these findings in 
## absolute terms.

epi.realrisk(measure = 2.91, measure.type = "odds.ratio", rE0 = 0.006)

## For those who do not smoke we would expect around 1 in every 100 to suffer
## from stroke. For those who smoke we would expect around 2 in every 100
## to suffer from stroke.


## EXAMPLE 2:
## In a controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments 
## in patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 (Horby et al., 2021), 
## patients were randomly assigned to receive oral or intravenous 
## dexamethasone for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The 
## primary outcome for this study was 28-day mortality. The risk of 28-day 
## mortality among patients receiving mechanical ventilation and usual care 
## was 0.414.

## The risk of death within 28 days of admission among mechanically 
## ventilated COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone was 0.64 
## (95\% CI 0.51 to 0.82) times that of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 
## patients receiving usual care. Report these findings in absolute terms.

epi.realrisk(measure = c(0.51,0.64,0.82), measure.type = "risk.ratio", 
   rE0 = 0.414)

## Out of 100 UK patients receiving mechanical ventilation and 
## usual care for COVID-19, we would expect around 41 to die after 28 days. 
## Out of 100 UK patients receiving mechanical ventilation and dexamethasone 
## for COVID-19, we would expect around 26 (95\% CI 21 to 34) to die after 
## 28 days.
