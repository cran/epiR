\description{
Sample size for a parallel superiority trial, binary outcome. 
}

\usage{
epi.sssupb(treat, control, delta, n, power, r = 1, sided.test, 
   nfractional = FALSE, alpha = 0.05)
}

\arguments{
  \item{treat}{the expected proportion of successes in the treatment group.}
  \item{control}{the expected proportion of successes in the control group.}
  \item{delta}{the equivalence limit, expressed as the absolute change in the outcome of interest that represents a clinically meaningful difference. For a superiority trial the value entered for \code{delta} must be greater than or equal to zero.}
  \item{n}{scalar, the total number of study subjects in the trial.}
  \item{power}{scalar, the required study power.}
  \item{r}{scalar, the number in the treatment group divided by the number in the control group.}
  \item{sided.test}{scalar, use a one- or two-sided test?}
  \item{nfractional}{logical, return fractional sample size.}
  \item{alpha}{scalar, defining the desired alpha level.}
}

\value{
A list containing the following: 
  \item{n.total}{the total number of study subjects required.}
  \item{n.treat}{the required number of study subject in the treatment group.}
  \item{n.control}{the required number of study subject in the control group.}
  \item{delta}{the equivalence limit, as entered by the user.}  
  \item{power}{the specified or calculated study power.}

\note{
Consider a clinical trial comparing two groups, a standard treatment (\eqn{s}) and a new treatment (\eqn{n}). A proportion of subjects in the standard treatment group experience the outcome of interest \eqn{P_{s}} and a proportion of subjects in the new treatment group experience the outcome of interest \eqn{P_{n}}.

For a superiority trial the null hypothesis is:

\eqn{H_{0}: P_{n} - P_{s} \leq \delta} 
 
and the alternative hypothesis is:

\eqn{H_{1}: P_{n} - P_{s} > \delta}

If the alternative hypothesis is accepted we conclude that \eqn{P_{n}} does not equal \eqn{P_{s}}. Regulatory agencies and most clinical trial guidelines recommend two-sided tests for superiority trials.

When calculating study power the argument \code{n} refers to the total study size (that is, the number of subjects in the treatment group plus the number in the control group).

Refer to the documentation for \code{\link{epi.ssequb}} for a comparison of the key features of superiority, equivalence and non-inferiority trials.}

## EXAMPLE 1 (from Chow S, Shao J, Wang H 2008, p. 91):
## Suppose that a pharmaceutical company is interested in conducting a
## clinical trial to compare the efficacy of two antimicrobial agents 
## when administered orally once daily in the treatment of patients 
## with skin infections. In what follows, we consider the situation 
## where the intended trial is for testing superiority of the 
## test drug over the active control drug. For this purpose, the following 
## assumptions are made. First, sample size calculation will be performed 
## for achieving 80\% power at the 5\% level of significance.

## Assume the true mean cure rates of the treatment agents and the active 
## control are 85\% and 65\%, respectively. Assume the superiority
## margin is 5\%.

epi.sssupb(treat = 0.85, control = 0.65, delta = 0.05, n = NA, 
   power = 0.80, r = 1, sided.test = 1, nfractional = FALSE, alpha = 0.05)

## A total of 196 subjects need to be enrolled in the trial, 98 in the 
## treatment group and 98 in the control group.
