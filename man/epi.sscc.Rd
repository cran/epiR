\details{
This function implements the methodology described by Dupont (1988). A detailed description of sample size calculations for case-control studies (with numerous worked examples, some of them reproduced below) is provided by Woodward (2014), pp. 295 - 329.

A value for \code{p1} is only required if Fleiss correction is used. For this reason the default for \code{p1} is set to \code{NA}.

The correlation between case and control exposures for matched pairs (\code{phi.coef}) can be estimated from previous studies using Equation (6.2) from Fleiss et al. 2003, p. 98. In the function \code{\link{epi.2by2}} the variable \code{phi.coef} is included with the output for each of the uncorrected chi-squared tests. This value can be used for argument \code{phi.coef} in \code{epi.sscc}. 

The methodology described in Woodward (2014), pp. 295 - 329 uses the proportion of discordant pairs to to determine the sample size for a matched case-control study. Note that the proportion of discordant pairs is likely to vary considerably between different studies since it depends not only on the correlation between case and control exposures but also on the exposure prevalence and the odds ratio. In contrast, estimates of \code{phi.coef} should be more stable between similar studies.

When no estimate of \code{phi.coef} is available, investigators may prefer to perform their power calculations under the assumption that \code{phi.coef} equals, say, 0.2 rather than make the questionable independence assumption required by most other methods.

A finite population correction factor is applied to the sample size estimates when a value for \code{N} is provided.

Power calculations used in this function are based on the uncorrected chi-square (as opposed to Fisher's exact) test.

\examples{
## EXAMPLE 1 (from Woodward 2014 Example 8.17 p. 318):
## A case-control study of the relationship between smoking and CHD is 
## planned. A sample of men with newly diagnosed CHD will be compared for
## smoking status with a sample of controls. Assuming an equal number of 
## cases and controls, how many study subject are required to detect an 
## odds ratio of 2.0 with 0.90 power using a two-sided 0.05 test? Previous 
## surveys have shown that around 0.30 of males without CHD are smokers.

epi.sscc(N = NA, OR = 2.0, p1 = NA, p0 = 0.30, n = NA, power = 0.90, r = 1, 
   phi.coef = 0, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, 
   conf.level = 0.95, method = "unmatched", fleiss = FALSE)

## A total of 376 men need to be sampled: 188 cases and 188 controls.


## EXAMPLE 2 (from Woodward 2014 Example 8.18 p. 320):
## Suppose we wish to determine the power to detect an odds ratio of 2.0 
## using a two-sided 0.05 test when 188 cases and 940 controls
## are available (that is, the ratio of controls to cases is 5:1). Assume 
## the prevalence of smoking in males without CHD is 0.30.

n <- 188 + 940
epi.sscc(N = NA, OR = 2.0, p1 = NA, p0 = 0.30, n = n, power = NA, r = 5, 
   phi.coef = 0, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, 
   conf.level = 0.95, method = "unmatched", fleiss = TRUE)

## The power of this study, with the given sample size allocation is 0.99.


## EXAMPLE 3:
## The following statement appeared in a study proposal to identify risk 
## factors for campylobacteriosis in humans:

## `We will prospectively recruit 300 culture-confirmed Campylobacter cases 
## reported under the Public Health Act. We will then recruit one control per 
## case from general practices of the enrolled cases, using frequency matching 
## by age and sex. With exposure levels of 10\% (thought to be realistic 
## given past foodborne disease case control studies) this sample size 
## will provide 80\% power to detect an odds ratio of 2 at the 5\% alpha 
## level.'

## Confirm the statement that 300 case subjects will provide 80\% power in 
## this study.

epi.sscc(N = NA, OR = 2.0, p1 = NA, p0 = 0.10, n = 600, power = NA, r = 1, 
   phi.coef = 0.01, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, 
   conf.level = 0.95, method = "matched", fleiss = TRUE)

## If the true odds ratio for Campylobacter in exposed subjects relative to 
## unexposed subjects is 2.0 we will be able to reject the null hypothesis 
## that this odds ratio equals 1 with probability (power) 0.826. The Type I 
# error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.


## EXAMPLE 4:
## We wish to conduct a case-control study to assess whether bladder cancer 
## may be associated with past exposure to cigarette smoking. Cases will be 
## patients with bladder cancer and controls will be patients hospitalised 
## for injury. It is assumed that 20\% of controls will be smokers or past 
## smokers, and we wish to detect an odds ratio of 2 with power 90\%. 
## Three controls will be recruited for every case. How many subjects need 
## to be enrolled in the study?

epi.sscc(N = NA, OR = 2.0, p1 = NA, p0 = 0.20, n = NA, power = 0.90, r = 3, 
   phi.coef = 0, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, 
   conf.level = 0.95, method = "unmatched", fleiss = FALSE)

## A total of 620 subjects need to be enrolled in the study: 155 cases and 
## 465 controls.

## An alternative is to conduct a matched case-control study rather than the 
## unmatched design outlined above. One case will be matched to one control 
## and the correlation between case and control exposures for matched pairs 
## (phi.coef) is estimated to be 0.01 (low). Using the same assumptions as 
## those described above, how many study subjects will be required?

epi.sscc(N = NA, OR = 2.0, p1 = NA, p0 = 0.20, n = NA, power = 0.90, r = 1, 
   phi.coef = 0.01, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, 
   conf.level = 0.95, method = "matched", fleiss = FALSE)

## A total of 456 subjects need to be enrolled in the study: 228 cases and 
## 228 controls.

## EXAMPLE 6 (from Dupont 1988, p. 1164):
## A matched case control study is to be carried out to quantify the 
## association between exposure A and an outcome B. Assume the prevalence 
## of exposure in controls is 0.60 and the correlation between case and 
## control exposures for matched pairs (phi.coef) is 0.20 (moderate). Assuming 
## an equal number of cases and controls, how many subjects need to be 
## enrolled into the study to detect an odds ratio of 3.0 with 0.80 power 
## using a two-sided 0.05 test? 

epi.sscc(N = NA, OR = 3.0, p1 = NA, p0 = 0.60, n = NA, power = 0.80, r = 1, 
   phi.coef = 0.2, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, 
   conf.level = 0.95, method = "matched", fleiss = FALSE)

## A total of 162 subjects need to be enrolled in the study: 81 cases and 
## 81 controls. 

## How many cases and controls are required if we select three 
## controls per case?

epi.sscc(N = NA, OR = 3.0, p1 = NA, p0 = 0.60, n = NA, power = 0.80, r = 3, 
   phi.coef = 0.2, design = 1, sided.test = 2, nfractional = FALSE, 
   conf.level = 0.95, method = "matched", fleiss = FALSE)

## A total of 204 subjects need to be enrolled in the study: 51 cases and 
## 153 controls.
