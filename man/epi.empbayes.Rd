\title{Empirical Bayes estimates of observed event counts}

\description{
Computes empirical Bayes estimates of observed event counts using the method of moments.
}

\usage{
epi.empbayes(obs, pop)
}

\arguments{
  \item{obs}{a vector representing the observed event counts in each unit of interest.}
  \item{pop}{a vector representing the population count in each unit of interest.}
}

\details{
The gamma distribution is parameterised in terms of shape (\eqn{\alpha}) and scale (\eqn{\nu}) parameters. The mean of a given gamma distribution equals \eqn{\nu / \alpha}. The variance equals \eqn{\nu / \alpha^{2}}. The empirical Bayes estimate of event risk in each unit of interest equals \eqn{(obs + \nu) / (pop + \alpha)}.

This technique performs poorly when your data contains large numbers of zero event counts. In this situation a Bayesian approach for estimating \eqn{\alpha} and \eqn{\nu} would be advised.
}

\value{
A data frame with four elements: \code{gamma} the mean event risk across all units, \code{phi} the variance of event risk across all units, \code{alpha} the estimated shape parameter of the gamma distribution, and \code{nu} the estimated scale parameter of the gamma distribution.

## EXAMPLE 1:

obs <- epi.SClip$cases; pop <- epi.SClip$population

est <- epi.empbayes(obs, pop)
crude.p <- ((obs) / (pop)) * 100000
crude.r <- rank(crude.p)
ebay.p <- ((obs + est[4]) / (pop + est[3])) * 100000

   Method = c(rep("Crude", times = length(crude.r)), 
      rep("Empirical Bayes", times = length(crude.r))),
